# RavStats!

## What it do
RavStats is a statistics generator for your Ravelry profile. It was done
somewhat quickly so that I could apply for a job with it.

## Running it
```
bundle
foreman start
```

## Current drawbacks
* Collecting stats for a user with lots of projects takes a looooong
  time
* Makes way too many API calls

## Wishful thinking
* Condense API calls (redis to cache results? Iunno)
* Better UI
* More stats!

## License
standard MIT. Let me know if you're doing anything cool.
